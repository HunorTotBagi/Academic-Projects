This project was within the course Modeling Seminar throughout my Master studies. 

Our team consisted of six students. 
We were given a scientific paper about movements of people in crowd.
First we had to analyse the sheets and make a short report, after that we made a numerical simulation in Python how people exit a room based on some probabilities.
