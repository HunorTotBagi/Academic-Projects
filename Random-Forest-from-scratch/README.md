This project was within the course Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning throughout my Master studies. The tasks were: 
1. Write the Random Forest algorithm from scratch
2. Estimate the missing output values in the data set
3. Test the algorithm performance based on numbers of Trees in the Forest, and numbers of samples in the Leaf
4. Compare r2 score, MSE with inbuilt Scikit-learn Random Forest function
5. Make a short presentation how the algorithm works and present the results
