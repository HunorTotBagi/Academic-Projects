This project was within the course Large Scale Data Mining throughout my Master studies.

An opportunity appeared with challenge organized as part of the sbv IMPROVER project, which aims to investigate the diagnostic potential of metagenomics data to discriminate patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the main goal of challenge is classification, the results in project are focused on the performance of various Autoencoders used for dimensionality reduction of data before the classification itself and they can be found in the Writeup pfd.

In this challenge our team placed 7th out of 13 teams.
