This project was within the course Network Science throughout my Master studies.

The goal of this project was to understand and make a Python implementation of the following centrality measures: eigenvector in-centrality, eigenvector out-centrality, the Katz centrality, the Bonacic alpha and (alpha,beta)-centrality, the HITS algorithm (also know as Hubs and Authorities) and the PageRank algorithm. The proposed algorithms were analysed and tested on a given network which changes throughout time.
