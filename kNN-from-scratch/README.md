This project was within the course Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning throughout my Master studies.

The tasks were: 
1. Draw random samples from normal distribution with given parameters, than to make density estimator
2. Test for different numbers of neighbors how does the quality of estimation changes
3. Pick a random sample and classify it respect to labels
