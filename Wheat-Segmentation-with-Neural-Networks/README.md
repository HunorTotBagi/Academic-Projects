This project was within the course Introduction to Image Processing throughout my Master studies.

We were given images of wheat from above from which we had to make labels where are the wheat heads located.
These labels and original images where forwarded to a Convolutional Neural Network to lean the patterns.
The main goal was to get predictions where are the wheat heads if we forward a new image to CNN. 
In the labeling process we manually counted how many wheat head are in the image.
We had to come up with algorithm to count the wheat heads from the predicted image.
